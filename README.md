# laptop_prices_exploration

## A python project using kaggle dataset on laptop prices. 

### Read the Background, Purpose, Findings and Next Steps for this data exploration here: (https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/laptop_prices_exploration/blob/main/laptop-prices-project.ipynb)
### Link to the kaggle dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset
### In this project I discovered a newfound love for the lambda function for data cleaning, specifically the classification of the laptop prices into quartiles using the lambda function.
